# Local Development Setup

## Fork & Clone the Repository

Fork & Clone the Repository

First, fork the repository on GitHub.

Then clone your fork locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/flowfi.git
cd flowfi
```

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS recommended)
- npm
- Rust & Cargo
- Docker & Docker Compose
- (Optional) Stellar CLI

---

## Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to run the full stack locally:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts:

- PostgreSQL (port 5432)
- Backend API (port 3001)

To run in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

To stop services:

```bash
docker compose down
```

To reset the database:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

---

## Option 2: Manual Setup

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

2. **Set Up Database**

The backend uses PostgreSQL. You can either:

- Use Docker Compose (recommended): `docker compose up postgres -d`
- Or set up PostgreSQL locally and configure `DATABASE_URL` in your `.env` file

3. **Run Database Migrations**

```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```

4. **Start Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Backend runs on: `http://localhost:3001`

**Available Backend Scripts:**

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build` - Build TypeScript to JavaScript
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run test` - Run test suite
- `npm run prisma:generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npm run prisma:migrate` - Run database migrations
- `npm run prisma:studio` - Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)

**Backend API Documentation:**

- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:3001/api-docs`
- OpenAPI Spec: `http://localhost:3001/api-docs.json`

---

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. **Start Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs on: `http://localhost:3000`

**Available Frontend Scripts:**

- `npm run dev` - Start Next.js development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

**Environment Variables:**
Create a `.env.local` file in the `frontend` directory if needed for API endpoints or other configuration.

---

### Smart Contracts Setup

1. **Install Rust Toolchain**

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed. If not:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

2. **Install Soroban CLI** (if not already installed)

```bash
cargo install --locked soroban-cli
```

3. **Build Contracts**

```bash
cd contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release
```

The compiled WASM files will be in `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/`.

**Contract Development:**

- Contract source: `contracts/stream_contract/src/lib.rs`
- Tests: `contracts/stream_contract/src/test.rs`
- Build target: `wasm32-unknown-unknown`

---

## Development Scripts & Tools

### Root-Level Scripts

From the repository root:

```bash
# Verify security setup
npm run verify-security
```

### Docker Compose Commands

```bash
# Start all services
docker compose up --build

# Start in detached mode
docker compose up -d --build

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Reset database (removes volumes)
docker compose down -v
```

## CI/CD Workflows

This repository uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Workflows are located in `.github/workflows/`.

### Available Workflows

- **Security Checks** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)
  - Runs on: push to `main`/`develop`, pull requests, and weekly schedule
  - Performs:
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning (`npm audit`)
    - CodeQL analysis for JavaScript/TypeScript
  - View workflow: [Security Checks](.github/workflows/security.yml)

### Running CI Checks Locally

Before pushing, ensure your changes pass:

```bash
# Frontend linting
cd frontend && npm run lint

# Backend tests
cd backend && npm run test

# Security verification
npm run verify-security
```

For more details, see the [Security Workflow](.github/workflows/security.yml).

# Branching Strategy

❌ Do NOT commit directly to `main`
✅ Always create a feature branch

## Branch Naming Convention

| Type     | Format                       | Example                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Feature  | `feature/short-description`  | `feature/add-stream-cancel`   |
| Bug Fix  | `fix/short-description`      | `fix/dashboard-loading-error` |
| Refactor | `refactor/short-description` | `refactor/api-service-layer`  |
| Docs     | `docs/short-description`     | `docs/update-contributing`    |
| Infra    | `infra/short-description`    | `infra/docker-improvement`    |

## Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Keep branch names short and descriptive.

# Commit Guidelines & Hooks

This repository uses **Husky** for commit hooks.

Before committing, ensure:

- Code compiles
- Lint passes
- No broken builds

## Commit Message Format

We follow a conventional style:

```
type(scope): short description
```

### Examples

```
feat(frontend): add wallet balance card
fix(backed): resolve stream validation bug
refactor(contracts): simplify transfer logic
docs: update setup instructions
```

## Commit Rules

- Use present tense ("add", not "added")
- Keep subject under ~72 characters
- Make atomic commits (one logical change per commit)
- Avoid vague messages like "update stuff"

---
